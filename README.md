[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toolness/algorithm-fun.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/toolness/algorithm-fun)

I'm reading through [The Algorithm Design Manual][adm] and this
repository contains some coding experiments based on it.

## Other Learning Objectives

* Learn and use [ES6][] features.
* Learn and use [SVG animations][].
* Write an [ES6 module loader][loader].

## Quick Start

Just host the root of this repository on a web server and visit it.

Alternatively, you can run `npm install` followed by `npm start` and visit
http://localhost:8080/.

Unit tests can be found at `/test/`.
